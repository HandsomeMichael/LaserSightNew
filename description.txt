This mod is a descendant of an original mod with the same name with same features

This mod adds a laser sight, which draws a line between character and mouse cursor

The difference between this and the original mod is the different use of draw method, and has a configuration rather than a command

Recommended mods to pair with this: [Terraria Overhaul] or [Daiyousei's Smooth Animations], could also be both

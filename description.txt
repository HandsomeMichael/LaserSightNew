This mod is a descendant of an original mod with the same name with same features

This mod adds a customizable laser sight, which draws a line between character and mouse cursor that collide with tiles and npcs, this mod also add a marker that makes you auto aim the enemy (these features can be toggled or disabled)

The difference between this and the original mod is the different use of draw method, and has a configuration rather than a command

Recommended mods to pair with this: [Terraria Overhaul] or [Daiyousei's Smooth Animations], could also be both

This mod is open source, you can find the link in the homepage

There is a mod config that lets you customize stuffs
